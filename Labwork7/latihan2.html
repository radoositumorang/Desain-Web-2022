      <h1>PTIK FKIP UNS</h1>

       The 
       <span class="blue_3">Faculty of Teacher Training and Education</span>,<span class="blue_3">Sebelas Maret University</span>, Surakarta is an 
       <span class="blue_5">Educational Personnel Education Institution (LPTK)</span> which has 24 study programs in 6 majors. Each study program has its own characteristics in producing 
        <span class="blue_4">superior, strong and intelligent educational staff.</span>
        <br> <br> 
        The <span class="red_3">Informatics and Computer Technology Education (PTIK)</span> tudy program is planned to take shelter in the management of the  
        <span  class="blue_1">Engineering and Vocational Education (PTK)</span> department. This placement revises our previous statement, where the PTIK study program is under the P.MIPA department. PTIK is a study program that will produce graduates who are
        <span class="red_4">prioritized to teach in vocational/vocational programs.</span> 
        So, it would be better if PTIK was under the PTK department which oversees vocational programs such as<span class="red_4">Building Engineering Education,</span>and
        <span  class="blue_3">Mechanical Engineering Education </span>To meet the needs of lecturers in the field of information technology that cannot be met by the PTK department, PTIK will conduct
        <span class="red_1">resource sharing with the mathematics study program</span>
